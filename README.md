Introduction
This project analyzes real-life data from the New York Stock Exchange. We used a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. 

Why this Project?
This project introduced us to the data analysis process used throughout the Nanodegree program. In this project, we go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is to perform an analysis and create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.



Background:
We used the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.

The following information is included in this Project data NYSE file:
Ticker symbol: Stock symbol
Years: Number of years for which data provided
Period ending
Total revenue
Cost of goods sold
Sales, General, and Administrative expenses
Research and Development expenses
Other Operating expense items
Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sector: The industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., American Airlines with the ticker symbol AAL categorized under Industrials.)
GICS Sub Industry: Sub-industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., AAL is further categorized under the sub-category of the airline industry.)

Project Goals:

Task 1: 
a. Identify the question about the data you will answer based on your data analysis, and include this in your slide presentation.

Your question should include at least one categorical variable (GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) and one quantitative variable (one of the financial metrics) and require the use of at least one of the summary statistics.
A tab within the Excel spreadsheet that you submit should include the summary statistics [measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation and range)] you used to answer your question.
Deliverable: Slide presentation, Spreadsheet with tab for Summary statistics

b. Your slide presentation should provide at least one visualization to help with your answer.

This visualization might be a bar chart, histogram, scatterplot, box plot, or other visual you learned to make. Include your insights from the measures of center and spread and at least one numeric summary statistic in the description.
Deliverable: Slide presentation (includes visualization)

Task 2:
Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.
Your drop-down list should pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement.
The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.
Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Dynamic P&L statement

Task 3:
Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) that forecasts the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case, and Base case).
Your assumptions on revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin should change for each scenario.
The forecasting model should be dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong). However, the forecasting model for the chosen company sticker symbol can be static.
